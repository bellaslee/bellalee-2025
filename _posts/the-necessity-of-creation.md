In this essay, I define art based on literary works, critical theory, and modern
philosophy. I then argue against the validity of AI generated art, using formal
creative venues as a frame of reference.

---

As an artist, I have experienced a spectrum of emotions following the advent of
generative artificial intelligence (referred to simply as AI for the rest of
this paper), from anger and defiance to grief and acceptance. This paper
explores a definition of creation first from a literary perspective, then
expands to encompass different art forms, and finally discusses generative
artificial intelligence’s role in the creative process. AI can be a powerful
tool for soliciting instant and unlimited feedback, but leaning on it to create
dilutes artistry and contributes to a disconnected society. Thus, outlets such
as art competitions, award shows, and literary journals should not allow
AI-generated content in any portion of a creative work.

To create a unified definition of authorship, we can consider previous works of
critical theory along with anecdotal evidence. Dan Sinykin sums up the author as
existing in three modalities: as a vessel through which external inspiration
manifests, as language speaking for itself, and as “social acts”. In all three
definitions, the author acts as a conduit, channeling the collective through the
individual. This definition can extend beyond just the author to encompass
different forms of creative expression, too.

However, this definition does not identify the purpose behind creation. Multiple
renowned authors have touched on the root of artistry in their works. In the
first part of her memoir, _Childhood_, Tove Ditlevsen writes, “Even though no
one else cares for my poems, I have to write them because it dulls the sorrow
and longing in my heart” (92). Reflecting on his short stories in _The Things
They Carried_, war veteran Tim O’Brien writes, “What stories can do, I guess, is
make things present. I can look at things I never looked at. I can attach faces
to grief and love and pity and God. I can be brave. I can make myself feel
again” (204). And in _Letters to a Young Poet_, Rainer Maria Rilke advises the
young poet Franz Kappus that “A work of art is good if it has arisen out of
necessity” (5). From these accounts, art manifests as a necessary act of
expressing oneself and reconciling with life’s hardships. Through writing, an
author can channel their thoughts, feelings, obsessions, and questions into a
concrete medium that communicates meaning beyond the words themselves. This act
allows the collective — inspiration, language, experiences, materiality,
culture, and so on — to merge and shine through the individual’s voice. For an
artist, creation is inevitable. It is a necessity.

Though the explanations of art as channeling the collective through the
individual and as a necessity encompass the human aspect of creation, they
remain unquantifiable. To ground the definitions, we can consider Ted Chiang’s
claim in his article "Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art" that “art is something
that results from making a lot of choices.” These choices form an artist’s style
and voice. Every word, every brush stroke, every chord — each of these are
meticulously constructed with intent. By this definition, art takes shape as any
form of expression a creator has put work into. Thus, we arrive at our final
definition of art: the necessary act of making deliberate choices to channel the
collective through the individual.

On the surface, the idea of artistry seems to have been shaken up by generative
AI’s public release. A plethora of AI-generated assets have since surfaced in
all areas, from social media posts and blog articles to graphic design and
marketing copy. However, in reality, AI is incapable of true creation. In
Chiang’s article, he claims that generative AI tools either “take an average of
choices that other writers have made,” which amounts “to the least interesting
choices possible,” or mimic the style of an existing author. No matter the
method, AI plagiarizes by non-consensually using words and ideas from its
dubiously acquired training data as its own. Though it does not necessarily
intend to plagiarize, it does so simply by design. This concept extends to
visual and auditory sources as well. Additionally, the LLMs output will far
exceed the user’s input, and the user is spared from having to make
energy-consuming decisions. Thus, “the person entering the prompt can’t claim
credit for” the AI’s output, and neither can the AI, despite its illusion of
originality. Furthermore, Chiang argues that AI cannot use language, as language
“requires an intention to communicate” — it “lies on top of these other
experiences of subjective feeling and of wanting to communicate that feeling.”
The desire to communicate a “subjective feeling” applies to our definition of
art as a necessity. As such, AI fundamentally is unable to express itself,
whether through language or other media, but people still tend to project
feelings onto it due to its common anthropoglossic design with a chat interface
(Bergstrom and West). Then, AI, at best, serves as an aggregation tool and, at
worst, unjustly plagiarizes from real creators.

With AI as an aggregation tool, there must be a point at which a work is no
longer created but instead generated. A work deserves as much attention as the
amount of effort that is put into it (Chiang). In other words, a completely
AI-generated artwork deserves no attention since it is made on the foundation of
stolen, unattributed, and pre-existing choices. Additionally, aggregated data is
depersonalized, and this concept applies, too, to AI, a choice-averaging
machine. Using any form of generative AI reduces the number of choices an artist
has made in their work, leading to communication with muffled intention. The
outcome is filtered through training data elements far removed from the
creator’s personal experiences and motivations. Thus, by incorporating
AI-generated output, artists decrease their connection with their audience. In
doing so, they lose parts of their voice and authenticity.

The notion that generative AI can contribute directly to creative works stems
from the current landscape of capitalism. The society we currently live in
emphasizes efficiency and values the product over the process. French
philosopher Baudrillard conceptualizes this type of culture as a consumer
society of manufactured desires, where everything is “asepticized into cold,
clinical communication” (Reid). Generative AI and LLMs take this “clinical
communication” to the extreme by producing endless, meaningless outputs, devoid
of intentionality. Creating a work with commercially available generative AI is
a means to an end. It generates a product without a personal process, with its
output far exceeding the input. It expands upon the skeleton of an idea,
auto-completing based on stolen works rather than genuine artistic process. The
spark of creation is not nurtured with care but instead thrown into an expedited
blender. Generative AI’s existence is a form of digital colonization, where the
end product is built on unjustly stolen work, and the colonizers are
technologists in power who believe art is a product and not a necessary process.

Allowing commercially available generative AI in formal creative venues sets a
precedent and encourages the public to view art as content and not the
encapsulation of a human experience. Yet to ban it completely would be a
disservice to those who express their creativity by harnessing machines and
algorithms. Since we understand art as “the necessary act of making deliberate
choices to channel the collective through the individual,” I believe generative
AI use should not be used to generate any part of the final work. It may be used
to solicit constructive feedback on the work, as long as the process does not
undermine the choices made by the artist. Any AI that the creator programs or
trains themselves should also be allowed, as the human input exceeds the machine
output. Ultimately, more human than machine choices should be made for a piece
to truly constitute art. Over-reliance on AI generations dilutes artist voices
and distances them from the audience, leading to a disconnected society where
human experiences are halfheartedly communicated through a veil of aggregated
output.
